        <h1>Modern Family</h1>
        <p>
          Modern Family is an American mockumentary family sitcom television
          series created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan for the
          American Broadcasting Company. It ran for eleven seasons, from
          September 23, 2009, to April 8, 2020. It follows the lives of three
          diverse family set-ups in suburban Los Angeles, linked by patriarch
          Jay Pritchett. <br /><br />

          Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan conceived the series while
          sharing stories of their own "modern families". Modern Family employs
          an ensemble cast and is presented in mockumentary style, with the
          characters frequently speaking directly to the camera in confessional
          interview segments. <br /><br /><br />

          The series was renewed for a 10th season on May 10, 2017,[1] which
          premiered on September 26, 2018;[2] then for an eleventh and final
          season on February 5, 2019, which premiered on September 25,
          2019.[3][4] The series finale aired on April 8, 2020.
          <br /><br /><br />

          Modern Family was acclaimed by critics throughout its first few
          seasons. Its critical reception became more mixed as it progressed,
          but it maintained a loyal fan base throughout its 11 seasons and was
          continuously popular. The final season received generally positive
          reception, and the finale episode had 7.37 million first-run
          viewers.[5] The retrospective documentary that aired before the final
          episode had 6.72 million first-run viewers. <br /><br /><br />

          The show won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in each of
          its first five years and the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting
          Actor in a Comedy Series four times, twice each for Eric Stonestreet
          and Ty Burrell, as well as the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a
          Comedy Series twice for Julie Bowen. It won a total of 22 Emmy awards
          from 75 nominations. It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best
          Television Series – Musical or Comedy in 2011. <br><br><br><br>

              Modern Family revolves around three different types of families
              (nuclear, blended and same-sex) living in the Los Angeles area,
              who are interrelated through Jay Pritchett and his children,
              daughter Claire and son Mitchell. Patriarch Jay remarried to a
              much younger woman, Gloria Delgado Pritchett (née Ramirez), a
              passionate Colombian immigrant with whom he has a young son,
              Fulgencio Joseph "Joe" Pritchett, and a son from Gloria's previous
              marriage, Manuel "Manny" Delgado. Jay's ex-wife Dede and Gloria's
              ex-husband Javier both make occasional appearances in the show.
              <br /><br /><br />

              Jay's daughter Claire was a homemaker, but has returned to the
              business world. She is now the chief executive of her father's
              business, Pritchett's Closets and Blinds. She is married to Phil
              Dunphy, a realtor and a self-professed "cool dad" who is an
              amateur magician as well. They have three children: Haley, a
              stereotypically ditzy teenage girl; Alex, an intelligent but nerdy
              middle child; and Luke, the offbeat only son. Haley's off again,
              on again boyfriend Dylan is a permanent fixture in the show.
              <br /><br /><br />

              Jay's lawyer son Mitchell and his husband Cameron Tucker have one
              adopted daughter, Lily Tucker-Pritchett, of Vietnamese origin. At
              the series finale, they adopt another child, a baby boy named
              Rexford. As the name suggests, this family represents a modern-day
              family, and episodes are comically based on situations that many
              families encounter in real life.

            Adaptations 3 adaptations of Modern Family have began episode
            making, launched in Chile, Greece and Iran. Chile: The channel MEGA
            was the first in the world to buy the rights of Modern Family to
            produce their own version of the series, with the title Familia
            Moderna. Greece: Mega Channel bought the rights of Modern Family for
            Greece and Cyprus and announced a Greek language adaptation, under
            the name Moderna Oikogeneia, which premiered on March 20, 2014. In
            the Greek adaptation of Modern Family, Lily is portrayed as a
            British girl rather than a Vietnamese girl. Also, her name remains
            the same. Iran: The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting produced a
            frame-by-frame remake of Modern Family, entitled Haft Sang, which
            premiered on June 30, 2014. However, on this version the same-sex
            relationship between Cam and Mitchell of the original series was
            replaced by a heterosexual relationship. Also, another thing that
            has gone AWOL is daughter Haley who, in this version, is replaced by
            a teenage boy. Also, due to this change, Haley's dim-witted
            boyfriend-turned-into-New Husband Dylan is replaced by a close
            friend of the teenage boy.
